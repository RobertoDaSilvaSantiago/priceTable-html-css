Price Table HTML and CSS

This project consists of a simple and responsive price table created using HTML and CSS. The price table includes three subscription plans: Basic, Standard, and Premium. Each plan displays the plan name, monthly price, features with corresponding icons, and a "Sign Up" button.

HTML Structure
The HTML document follows standard practices and includes:

<!DOCTYPE html> declaration for HTML5.
Meta tags for character set and viewport settings.
Title tag set to "Price Table."
A link to an external CSS file named "style.css."
Three subscription blocks (block1 div) with plan details, prices, feature lists, and "Sign Up" buttons.
CSS Styling
The CSS file provides styling for the HTML content. Key features include:

Use of the Trebuchet MS font for the entire page.
A container with an aqua background, flex display, and centered content.
Each subscription block (block1) with a yellow background, maximum width, text alignment, border-radius, and padding.
Stylized plan names, prices, and feature lists with specific font sizes and weights.
Red "Sign Up" buttons with custom styling.
Responsiveness
The CSS includes a media query to adjust the layout for screen widths up to 1250 pixels, changing the container to a column layout.
